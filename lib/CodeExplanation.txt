STRATEGY FOR CHECKING AND DEAING WINNNGS:
We start by sorting the players who have contributed the least to the pot to the ones who have contributed the most and add those who called all the way to the end (in any order).
Then we loop through players and on every loop we get winners. Here it's important to understand:

- the player who contributed to the pot the least is first on the loop, and must win the hand to every other player (or split)
- if the player wins he takes his share of the stakes everyone else invested in pot or splits his share with others if there are more winners.
- at that point the money is taken from the pot so the following players cannot claim it again
- the players after him contributed more to the pot, so they do not need to win against his hand, as his winnings were already been taken care of
- next player repeats the process, taking only his share of the winnings and reducing the other ones
- if the previous player has won a share of his pot, that is not a problem, because everyone has been taken his share away (or all their money if his share <= their share),
  so that player is competing with fewer players to get the stakes that were left after the previous had taken a share.
- there are shares definitely left or are 0 because of the order of players through which the loop loops

there are two possibilities for a player that has won or split the pot with players who have invested more than him:
- either a player takes all the money from a person (or he splits it equally with other winners) if the amount of money invested
   by that person is equal or smaller than that of a player
- or he takes as much as he invested from a person (or splits his investment subtracted from person equally with winners) if he the amount of money invested
  by that person is larger than his


- create relocation of money (base_money is outside games being played)
- create user data in greater detail (folded hands,...)
